This project demonstrates a slightly different approach to deploying an EC2 instance on AWS.  

Instead of embedding all commands in the Terraform userdata script, it uses `cloud-init` to automate instance setup. NGINX is installed and configured on boot, making the instance ready to serve HTTP traffic immediately. It’s a simple example of automated instance provisioning.

## Why Cloud-Init?

Using cloud-init provides a cleaner and more maintainable way to configure instances compared to writing longer bash scripts:

- You mostly **describe what the instance should do** rather than writing every single command manually.  
- Built-in modules handle common tasks like **setting up SSH keys, installing packages, configuring services, or managing users**.  
- YAML configuration is **easier to read and interpret**, making the setup clearer for anyone reviewing the code.  
- Future updates or changes to instance setup are **simpler to apply** without touching Terraform logic.

## Terraform Provisioned Resources

- EC2 instance running NGINX
- Default VPC with a public subnet selected for the instance
- Security group allowing inbound HTTP traffic on port 80
- Cloud-init YAML script that installs and configures NGINX on boot

## How It Works

1. Terraform provisions an EC2 instance in the default VPC.  
2. Cloud-init runs at boot and installs NGINX, enabling and starting the service automatically.  
3. The instance receives a public IP so it’s reachable over the internet.  
4. Security group allows inbound HTTP traffic from anywhere.  
5. Once the instance finishes booting, NGINX is serving content immediately.
